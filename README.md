Code for master's thesis project. Different parts of the code do different things:
- PhantomCreator.py simulates simple mammographic phantoms with benign and malignant masses as well as calcifications.
- XrayMachine.py measures the phantoms using radon transform
- Networks.py contains networks that reconstruct the simulated phantoms from measurement data with convolutional neural nets
